# OpenAI Conversion Proxy

Welcome to the OpenAI Conversion Proxy project! 🌈 This nifty edge computing script is crafted with love to run on Cloudflare Workers, leveraging Cloudflare's awesome policy that allows up to 100,000 free invocations per day. 🚀 Perfect for personal projects, research, and all sorts of learning adventures, this setup offers an affordable gateway to the wonders of AI services from Azure, OpenAI, Groq Cloud, and the newly added Coze with its fabulous plugin ecosystem that makes building RAG applications a breeze and supercharges your AI capabilities. ✨

🚀 **Getting Started**

Ready to launch your OpenAI Conversion Proxy into the stratosphere? Just follow these easy-peasy steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   Kick things off by cloning the repository to your local machine with this magic spell:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/loadchange/openai-conversion-proxy.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Zip into the cloned repository directory and beam up the necessary dependencies by casting:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Deploy to Cloudflare Workers**
   With the dependencies all cosy, launch your proxy to Cloudflare Workers by enchanting:
   ```
   npm run deploy
   ```
   This incantation smoothly handles the deployment process, putting your OpenAI proxy online for the world to see. 🌍

🔧 **Configuration Guide**

Before blasting off, you'll need to configure your spacecraft... I mean, project, for the AI services. I've conjured up some detailed configuration guides to help you get everything shipshape:
- [Azure and OpenAI Setup](https://github.com/loadchange/openai-conversion-proxy/pull/7)
- [Coze Configuration Guide](https://github.com/loadchange/openai-conversion-proxy/pull/9) - Explore the universe of RAG applications with Coze's extensive plugin ecosystem.
- [Groq Cloud Configuration Guide](https://github.com/loadchange/openai-conversion-proxy/pull/10) - Groq Cloud is your free ticket to fast response times, supporting the latest LLaMA3 series models.
- [~~GlobalGPT~~ Configuration Guide](https://github.com/loadchange/openai-conversion-proxy/pull/8) - Heads up: Due to some turbulence in service stability, ~~GlobalGPT~~ is being phased out. 🚫

⚠️ **Attention**: Brace for impact! Due to service instability, ~~GlobalGPT~~ is being jettisoned from our recommended tools. I encourage you to check out Coze for a smoother and more powerful AI journey.

🛠️ **Usage**

Once your OpenAI Conversion Proxy is orbiting smoothly, it'll act as a cosmic intermediary between your applications and the AI services, allowing you to:
- Harness diverse AI models from Azure, OpenAI, Groq Cloud, and Coze.
- Utilize Cloudflare's caching and usage monitoring to optimize your fuel... I mean, costs.
- Easily navigate between AI service providers without having to reconfigure your spaceship's dashboard.

🤝 **Contributing**

Got ideas to make this spaceship even cooler? Contributions are more than welcome! Whether you're reporting a meteor shower (bug) or adding some new thrusters (features), feel free to open an issue or a pull request. Check out the contribution guidelines for more on how to join our crew!
